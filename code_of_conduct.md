#Code of Conduct
Hack The People is dedicated to providing a harassment-free mentorship experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of Hack The People mentor and mentee participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Hack The People sponsored events.
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants whether they be mentors, mentees, volunteers, staff, or anyone else involved in Hack The People events. Behave professionally. Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Hack The People events.

Attendees violating these rules may be warned and or asked to no longer attend Hack The People events, mentorship program, and programming clubs without a refund at the sole discretion of the Hack The People officers, board, and staff.
Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly organization for all.
